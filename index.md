# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/fadhilayosof/linear-regression-project)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**94%** accuracy](https://github.com/fadhilayosof/linear-regression-project).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/fadhilayosof/Knn_Nb_Project1)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**80%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Orthopedic-Patients-Classification).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Handwriting Classification Project](https://github.com/fadhilayosof/hand_writting_recognition_project.)

<img src="images/Handwriting.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Recognition of handwritten text using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**97%** using **5** epochs](https://github.com/fadhilayosof/hand_writting_recognition_project.).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to identify the correct handwritten number.

[Identifying Symptoms of Orthopedic Patients as Normal or Abnormal](https://github.com/fadhilayosof/Knn_Nb_Project1/blob/main/Knn_Nb_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/Orthopedics.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,KNN,NB

**Project Objective:** In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and we are also provided with their classification as Normal or Abnormal. We have to implement K Nearest Neighbor, the algorithm is used to classify points according to class of their K nearest neighbor points. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the orthopedic parameters as Normal or Abnormal with an accuracy of. [**88.71%**]
https://github.com/fadhilayosof/Knn_Nb_Project1/blob/main/Knn_Nb_Project.ipynb.

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patientâ€™s condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters.
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data.
- Selected best model based on train and test performance.
